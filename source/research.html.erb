      <div id="description1" class="description collapse">
        <p>Quantum coherences can appear when superpositions of excitons are coherently excited. They dephase from interactions with their respective environments, which is why quantum coherences are usually exploited (a) at low temperature and/or (b) isolated from their environments. However, sometimes systems exhibit slower dephasing than expected, even in physiological environments.</p>
        <p>If the nuclear motions perturbing the quantum states are correlated to each other, then the dephasing can be slowed. I study whether photosynthesis employs this strategy.</p>
        <p>Using 2D electronic spectroscopy, I observe the time-ordered vibrational motion occurring on distinct excitons in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) pigment-protein complex in different time periods. By allowing one exciton’s spectral motion to propagate, and then checking a distinct exciton’s spectral motion at a later time, I can detect if the unoccupied exciton’s associated nuclear bath has propagated while an entirely different exciton was excited.</p>

      <div id="description2" class="description collapse">
        <p>There are plenty of reasons to want to find a small peak hidden in a congested optical spectrum.</p>
        <p>The congestion often arises because electronic states are pinned onto their nuclear scaffolds. When a coherent state is on a jittering scaffold, it dissipates quantum information. Fast dissipation causes dynamic inhomogeneous broadening, while slower dissipation causes homogeneous broadening. Even 2D spectroscopy, which is supposed to be good at distinguishing spectral features, suffers from this effect.</p>
        <p>By eliminating the fast component in the time domain, the spectra become much better resolved. This technique works on experimental and calculated (HEOM) 2D spectra.</p>

      <div id="description3" class="description collapse">
        <p>Like matter, light has a quantized orbital angular momentum. This degree of freedom promises Tbit/s optical multiplexing, denser qubits, improved quantum communication, and more.</p>
        <p>However, this "twisted" light is currently read using impractical and expensive optical techniques. Taking a cue from conventional optical detectors, it would be better to use a solid state medium to read out the orbital angular momentum of the light.</p>
        <p>We have found unique spectra and dynamics depending on the orbital angular momentum encoded into otherwise identical light. This effect arises from the unique current density patterns generated by light whose wavefronts are helical rather than planar, generating excitations with coherent spatial patterns that encode the quantum information. These results invite new basic science. For example, exploring the creation of magnetic fields by the light, as it stirs a transverse current density of the sample much like a current traveling through a circular wire.</p>

    <ol>
      <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#description4"><li>Defrayed exciton dissociation increases power conversion efficiencies</li></a>
      <div id="description4" class="description collapse">
        <p>About ten years ago, heterogeneous polymers began breaking records in power conversion efficiencies set by homopolymers such as P3HT, but it was not immediately clear why. Traditional benchmarks such as the film crystallinity often looked worse in these heteropolymers and, contrary to expectation, processes like annealing often made them perform worse. Even their redder absorption spectra could not fully explain their higher efficiencies.</p>
        <p>Using transient spectroscopy, I studied the intradonor events occuring before charge transfer within the bulk heterojunction films. Organic photovoltaics traditionally rely on donor-acceptor interfaces to drive exciton dissociation. The associated energy cost is taxed from every dissociation event, passing a substantial penalty onto the power conversion efficiency. We found that the dissimilar monomer units along the polymer backbone partially defrayed the cost of exciton dissociation by preparing charge transfer states within the polymer.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the extent of this charge transfer state formation within the solvated polymers directly correlated to the power conversion efficiencies obtained from the intact bulk heterojunction device. This was an unexpected result, as it does not consider the aggregation characteristics or time-domain mesoscale dynamics that are traditionally mainly associated with device efficiencies.</p>

      <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#description5"><li>Self-assembly by overriding intermolecular interactions</li></a>
      <div id="description5" class="description collapse">
        <p>Aggregation characteristics are often very important in organic photovoltaics, because they determine exciton dissociation efficiencies, as well as free charge carrier mobilities and collection probabilities. Notoriously, it is difficult to get the same device parameters from one bulk heterojunction device to the next, in large part due to variations in the aggregation characteristics even under the same fabrication conditions. Methodologies to address this problem can include expensive annealing, vapor deposition, and related processes in order to tune or repair the aggregation characteristics.</p>
        <p>Spontaneous self-assembly is a promising response to these challenges. It happens "for free," ie. without processing steps, and can produce highly regular aggregates. Using X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy, we found that certain thiophene-derived oligomers can spontaneously form long, crystalline ribbons in their thin films. This effect occurs because the distinct sides of the oligomer have unique electrostatic effects, which variably dominate under distinct backbone length scales. By achieving a balance, regular order can be achieved across long distances.</p>
